Implementation of checks UI for Github Actions
==================================================

Really basic integration with GitHub Actions. This module allows querying Github Actions for current run status. The GitHub branches **MUST** be named
in the form `ci/<gerrit change id>/<patchset revision>` for this to work.

More customizability might be forthcoming.
